Command to send to existing /usr/libexec/sharingd when installing a new plugin or new version of a plugin:
#dbus-send --session --print-reply --dest=com.intel.sharing /com/intel/sharing com.intel.sharing.RescanPlugins

However, I have to figure out how to do this in the user's DBUS session from an RPM post-install section...
